# We-Men: A Social Media Platform with Advanced Face Verification
## Say no to DeepFake and MMS here at WeMen

## Overview

**We-Men** is an innovative social media platform designed with a focus on privacy, security, and the prevention of deepfake misuse. The platform ensures that users are in control of their images by utilizing advanced face verification technology. 

### Key Features

1. **User Registration and Face Verification**:
    - During registration, users are required to undergo face verification.
    - The platform captures a video of the user, generates a unique face ID, and securely stores it.
    - Until face verification is complete, the user’s account remains inactive.

2. **Secure Login with Continuous Face Verification**:
    - Each time a user logs in, they must verify their identity via face recognition.
    - The platform captures an image or video during login, comparing it to the stored face ID to confirm the user's identity.

3. **Image Posting and Face Analysis**:
    - When users post images, the platform analyzes the photo to detect faces.
    - Detected faces are matched against the database of stored face IDs.
    - The platform ensures that images containing the user's face or those of their friends are securely processed.
    - If unrecognized faces are detected, the system alerts the identified person in the database, helping prevent unauthorized use of personal images.

4. **Deepfake and MMS Protection**:
    - The platform helps users protect their identities by detecting deepfakes and notifying them of any suspicious activity involving their face on the platform.
